# Inkblotz!
Awarded with the prize for The Best Workshop Project at VandyHack 2019. 
Help Mr. Pinkie find his way home by defeating the monsters and drawing the way out! This game will bring you back your childhood creativity and fun. Pick up your pen and start doodling now!!!

## Inspiration
Inspired by our childhood memory of drawing monsters and warriors on scratch paper, we created this game to bring back the simple times of unlimited creativity and imagination. 

## What it does
This is a 2D pixel adventure game. The players will interact with the game by drawing the way to the next level and remove the obstacle by using an eraser. The goal is to safely navigate Mr. Pinkie to the pink gate at each level and defeat all the monsters that are in his way. There will be a hidden surprise at the end of the game for those who are sharp-eyed!

## How we built it
The game was built using Unity3d. We learned the Unity3d engine from scratch and also from the workshop. The core interaction system was written in C# and used the DotNet framework. We also designed the art style of the game and created all of the UI and animation by ourselves. The graphics were designed using _Scratchbook _ and _Adobe Photoshop_. 

## Challenges we ran into
Sleep deprivation
Struggle to come up with a creative name of the game
Weird errors occur from time to time in the engine as we are new, but mentors helped us through a lot of them.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Design and actualize a fully-functional game with a decent gameplay experience from scratch in just 20 hours. Learned the game engine on the fly and hand drew all of the game UIs and animations.

## What we learned
Full-stack development of a game/app.
Life-cycle management of projects
Graphic design
